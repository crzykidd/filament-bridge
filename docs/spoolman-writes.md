# Spoolman writes reference

Every field filament-bridge writes to Spoolman, and when. The bridge interacts with
Spoolman in two contexts: **structural setup** (custom fields it registers) and **data
writes** (the one-time wizard import, and ongoing auto-sync cycles). The bridge only ever
uses documented Spoolman REST APIs; it never deletes Spoolman records.

## Custom extra fields the bridge registers

Created once at startup (`ensure_extra_fields()`). Key names are overridable via env vars.

**Spool-level extras** (`SPOOLMAN_FIELD_FILAMENTDB_ID`, `SPOOLMAN_FIELD_FILAMENTDB_PARENT_ID`,
`SPOOLMAN_FIELD_FILAMENTDB_SPOOL_ID`):

| Field key | Type | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `filamentdb_id` | text | FDB filament ID (cross-reference link) |
| `filamentdb_parent_id` | text | FDB variant parent ID |
| `filamentdb_spool_id` | text | FDB spool subdocument ID |

**Filament-level extras** (`SPOOLMAN_FIELD_FILAMENTDB_MATERIAL_TAGS` env var, default
`filamentdb_material_tags`; OpenTag identity fields `SPOOLMAN_FIELD_OPENPRINTTAG_SLUG`
/ `SPOOLMAN_FIELD_OPENPRINTTAG_UUID`, defaults `openprinttag_slug` / `openprinttag_uuid`):

| Field key | Type | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `filamentdb_material_tags` | text | OpenPrintTag finish IDs as a CSV string (e.g. `17` for silk, `16,17`), JSON-quoted on the wire like all text extras |
| `openprinttag_slug` | text | OpenPrintTag material slug (e.g. `buddy3d-pla-silk-bronze`) — written by the OpenTag cleanup tool Apply action |
| `openprinttag_uuid` | text | OpenPrintTag material UUID — written by the OpenTag cleanup tool Apply action |
| `openprinttag_ignore` | text | `"1"` when the user has suppressed future update alerts for this filament via the Updates Review view; empty string = not ignored |

**Filament-level OpenPrintTag material-setting extras** (TYPED; keys overridable via
`SPOOLMAN_FIELD_OPENPRINTTAG_*` env vars). These hold standardized OPT material settings
Spoolman has no native field for but Filament DB can store as first-class fields. Populated
from OpenPrintTag by the OpenTag cleanup Apply flow, then synced ↔ FDB by the
material-properties sync pass (same direction + conflict policy as the other material fields):

| Field key | Type | FDB counterpart | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|
| `openprinttag_nozzle_temp_min` | integer | `temperatures.nozzleRangeMin` | OPT `nozzleTempMin` (°C) |
| `openprinttag_nozzle_temp_max` | integer | `temperatures.nozzleRangeMax` | OPT `nozzleTempMax` (°C) |
| `openprinttag_drying_temp` | integer | `dryingTemperature` | OPT `dryingTemp` (°C) |
| `openprinttag_drying_time` | integer | `dryingTime` | Drying time in **minutes** (OpenPrintTag and Filament DB both use minutes — passes through unchanged) |
| `openprinttag_hardness_shore_a` | float | `shoreHardnessA` | OPT `hardnessShoreA` |
| `openprinttag_hardness_shore_d` | float | `shoreHardnessD` | OPT `hardnessShoreD` |
| `openprinttag_transmission_distance` | float | `transmissionDistance` | OPT `transmissionDistance` (mm) |
| `openprinttag_bed_temp_max` | integer | *(Spoolman-only)* | OPT `bedTempMax` (°C) — FDB's single `temperatures.bed` is already synced via the native `settings_bed_temp` channel, so this extra is not a second writer |
| `openprinttag_bed_temp_min` | integer | *(Spoolman-only)* | OPT `bedTempMin` (°C) — no FDB bed-range field; stored in Spoolman only |
| `openprinttag_chamber_temp_min` | integer | *(Spoolman-only)* | OPT `chamberTempMin` (°C) |
| `openprinttag_chamber_temp_max` | integer | *(Spoolman-only)* | OPT `chamberTempMax` (°C) |
| `openprinttag_chamber_temp` | integer | *(Spoolman-only)* | OPT `chamberTemp` (°C) — collapsed back-compat value |
| `openprinttag_preheat_temp` | integer | *(Spoolman-only)* | OPT `preheatTemp` (°C) |
| `openprinttag_nozzle_diameter_min` | float | *(Spoolman-only)* | OPT `nozzleDiameterMin` (mm) |
| `openprinttag_cure_wavelength` | integer | *(Spoolman-only)* | OPT `cureWavelength` (nm) — relevant for resins/UV materials |

All extras are stored JSON-encoded (`encode_extra_value`) — including the typed numeric ones
(Spoolman returns `230` as `"230"`, which `decode_extra_value` parses back to `230`).
Everything below writes native Spoolman fields or these extras.

## Ongoing auto-sync writes (per cycle, change-driven)

These are **Filament DB → Spoolman** writes. Each fires only when the category's
configured **sync direction + conflict policy** routes the change to Spoolman (two-way
lone change, one-way FDB→SM, or an FDB-winning conflict policy). See
[the sync direction/conflict model](decisions.md).

| Entity | Field(s) | Trigger |
|---|---|---|
| Spool | `remaining_weight` (net; converted from FDB gross via `fdb_to_spoolman_net`) | Weight sync resolves FDB→SM for the pair |
| Filament | `color_hex`, `multi_color_hexes`, `multi_color_direction` | Multicolor sync resolves FDB→SM (Filament DB ≥ 1.33.0) |
| Filament | `price` | Cost sync resolves FDB→SM (filament price only — never per-spool price) |
| Filament | `settings_bed_temp` | Temperature sync resolves FDB→SM (from FDB `temperatures.bed`) |
| Filament | `settings_extruder_temp` | Temperature sync resolves FDB→SM (from FDB `temperatures.nozzle`) |
| Filament | `material` | Native-scalar sync (FR-11 Phase A) resolves FDB→SM (`type` → `material` name remap) |
| Filament | `density` | Native-scalar sync resolves FDB→SM |
| Filament | `diameter` | Native-scalar sync resolves FDB→SM |
| Filament | `spool_weight` | Native-scalar sync resolves FDB→SM (from FDB `spoolWeight`) |
| Filament | `weight` | Native-scalar sync resolves FDB→SM (from FDB `netFilamentWeight`) |
| Filament | `extra.filamentdb_material_tags` | Finish-tag sync resolves FDB→SM (Filament DB ≥ 1.33.0); CSV of OpenPrintTag IDs from FDB `optTags` |
| Filament | `extra.openprinttag_{nozzle_temp_min,nozzle_temp_max,drying_temp,drying_time,hardness_shore_a,hardness_shore_d,transmission_distance}` | OpenPrintTag material-setting sync (FDB ↔ SM bidirectional) for the 7 fields that have a dedicated FDB counterpart. Master/variant-gated; both snapshots refresh after a write (anti-ping-pong) |
| Filament | `extra.openprinttag_{bed_temp_max,bed_temp_min,chamber_temp_min,chamber_temp_max,chamber_temp,preheat_temp,nozzle_diameter_min,cure_wavelength}` | Spoolman-only OPT extras — populated by the OpenTag Apply flow; **no FDB sync via this pass**, never read or written to Filament DB by the OPT material-setting sync. (Bed temp still reaches FDB `temperatures.bed` through the native `settings_bed_temp` channel above.) |
| Spool | `extra.{mapped field}` | Generic field-mapping sync (FR-11) resolves FDB→SM; arbitrary mapped FDB fields stored as spool extras |
| Spool | `archived` (bool) | Lifecycle sync resolves FDB→SM — a *mapped* spool retired in Filament DB (`retired`) flips Spoolman `archived` to match; un-retire mirrors back (`archived: false`). Runs **after** the weight pass so a depleted spool's final decrement settles first. Governed by `archive_sync_direction` / `archive_conflict_policy`, not by `never_import_empties`. See [sync-model.md](sync-model.md). |

New-spool creation during a cycle (gated by `new_spool_sync_direction`):

| Entity | Op | Field(s) | Trigger |
|---|---|---|---|
| Spool | create | `filament_id`, `remaining_weight`, + the 3 cross-ref extras | A new FDB spool has no Spoolman counterpart |
| Spool | update | the 3 cross-ref extras | After creating an FDB spool from a new SM spool — links it back |

## Wizard initial-import writes (one-time, on Execute)

**Filament DB → Spoolman import direction:**

| Entity | Op | Field(s) |
|---|---|---|
| Vendor | create | `name` (deduplicated by normalized name) |
| Filament | create | `name`, `material`, `color_hex`, `density`, `spool_weight`, `vendor_id` |
| Spool | create | `filament_id`, `remaining_weight`, + 3 cross-ref extras |

**Spoolman → Filament DB import direction:**

| Entity | Op | Field(s) | Trigger |
|---|---|---|---|
| Spool | update | 3 cross-ref extras | After creating the FDB spool — links it back |
| Filament | update | `extra.filamentdb_material_tags` | Pass 2.6 — writes parsed finish-tag IDs (from SM name/material text) back so SM's extra field matches FDB's `optTags` |
| Filament | update | `material`, `density`, `diameter`, `settings_extruder_temp`, `settings_bed_temp`, `spool_weight` | Variances **reconcile write-back** — only fields the user corrected, and only where the value differs from current Spoolman |

For FDB spool creates: when the source SM spool is **archived**, the bridge sets `retired: true`
on the FDB spool payload so the archived state is preserved at import. Only the spool is
marked retired — the filament record is always created as a normal, non-retired filament.
Beyond this import-time stamp, `archived`/`retired` IS a synced field in ongoing auto-sync
for already-mapped pairs (lifecycle sync, see the auto-sync table above and
[sync-model.md](sync-model.md)).

## Conflict-resolution writes (on-demand, human-approved)

Two conflict types write upstream on resolution (`POST /api/conflicts/{id}/resolve`) — the
chosen action/resolution is the authorisation (see `docs/conflicts.md`):

**`master_divergence`** (resolved with an `action`):

| Action | Entity | Op | Field(s) |
|---|---|---|---|
| `apply_all` | Filament | update | The diverged native field (`material`, `density`, `diameter`, `spool_weight`, `weight`, `settings_bed_temp`, `settings_extruder_temp`) on **every mapped Spoolman filament in the variant line** |
| `variant_override` / `ignore` | — | — | No Spoolman writes (FDB-only / no-op respectively) |

**Lifecycle** — a `cross_system` conflict with `field_name="lifecycle"` (resolved with
`resolution` = `spoolman`/`filamentdb`/`manual`). Unlike all other `cross_system` conflicts
(which are record-only), this one converges by writing the chosen boolean to **both**
systems and refreshing both snapshots (via the scoped `apply_lifecycle_conflict` path, not
the generic record-only resolver):

| Entity | Op | Field(s) |
|---|---|---|
| Spool | update | `archived` (chosen boolean) |
| Spool (FDB) | update | `retired` (same chosen boolean) |

All other conflict types are record-only — resolving them performs no upstream writes.

## OpenTag cleanup tool writes (on-demand, on Apply)

`POST /api/openprinttag/apply` — the explicit user action that authorises these writes.
Only the fields the user confirmed (not marked "keep mine") are written.

| Entity | Op | Field(s) | Trigger |
|---|---|---|---|
| Filament | update | `name` | User confirmed the reviewable name field (defaults to the OpenTag material name) |
| Filament | update | `vendor` → `vendor_id` | User confirmed the Manufacturer field; the Manufacturer row surfaces whenever SM vendor and OpenTag brand differ by any visible character (including case-only). Resolved via find-or-create (`_ensure_vendor`): exact trimmed name match against existing vendors; creates a new vendor if no exact match. Re-points THIS filament only — existing vendor never renamed, other filaments never touched. A case-only diff intentionally creates a near-duplicate vendor (accepted trade-off). **This is the only OpenTag path that may CREATE a new Spoolman vendor.** |
| Filament | update | `material`, `color_hex`, `density`, `diameter`, `settings_extruder_temp`, `settings_bed_temp`, `multi_color_hexes`, `multi_color_direction` (any subset) | User confirmed in the review/confirm UI |
| Filament | update | `extra.openprinttag_{nozzle_temp_min,nozzle_temp_max,drying_temp,drying_time,hardness_shore_a,hardness_shore_d,transmission_distance,bed_temp_min,bed_temp_max,chamber_temp_min,chamber_temp_max,chamber_temp,preheat_temp,nozzle_diameter_min,cure_wavelength}` (any subset) | User confirmed; all 15 typed OPT material-setting extras. Only emitted as review rows when the OPT material carries the value. `drying_time` is in minutes (no conversion — FDB `dryingTime` is also minutes). Spoolman-only fields (bed_temp_min, chamber_*, preheat_temp, nozzle_diameter_min, cure_wavelength) are written to Spoolman but never synced to FDB |
| Filament | update | `spool_weight`, `weight` (native) | User confirmed; weight-model bonus from the OPT material→package→container lookup — container `emptyWeight` → `spool_weight` (tare), package `nominalNettoFullWeight` → `weight`. Only surfaced when the dataset has package/container data for the matched material |
| Filament | update | `extra.filamentdb_material_tags` | User confirmed; JSON list of finish IDs from the OPTMaterial tags |
| Filament | update | `extra.openprinttag_slug`, `extra.openprinttag_uuid` | Always written for non-ignored filaments with a match |
| Filament | update | `extra.openprinttag_slug` = `""`, `extra.openprinttag_uuid` = `""` | **Unmatch** — when the user stages "— unmatch —" in the candidate dropdown (decision `clear_identity=true`) or calls `POST /api/openprinttag/clear/{id}`. Blanks both identity extras; does NOT touch `openprinttag_ignore`. |

After each SM write the apply endpoint also calls `FilamentDBClient.merge_filament_settings()`
to push `openprinttag_slug`/`openprinttag_uuid` into the linked FDB filament's `settings{}`
bag (scoped exception — see `docs/decisions.md`).

For an **unmatch** the apply/clear path instead calls
`FilamentDBClient.remove_filament_settings_keys()` to delete only those two identity keys from
the linked FDB filament's `settings{}` bag (the approved scoped *removal* exception — every
other settings key is preserved; idempotent; best-effort). The FDB filament id is taken from
the decision or resolved from the Spoolman filament's `filamentdb_id` cross-ref extra.

## What the bridge never writes to Spoolman

`location`, `lot_nr`, `comment`, and **per-spool `price`** (cost write-back targets the
filament price only). The bridge never deletes Spoolman records. (`archived` *is* written —
by the lifecycle sync pass for mapped pairs and by lifecycle conflict resolution — see
above.)

**The bridge never sets both `color_hex` and `multi_color_hexes` on the same Spoolman
filament in a single PATCH.** Spoolman returns 422 if both are present simultaneously.
Multicolor writes use `multi_color_hexes` + `multi_color_direction` only; single-color
writes use `color_hex` only. This applies to both the ongoing sync passes and the OpenTag
apply endpoint.

## Notes

- **Weight is always net-converted** on the way in (`fdb_to_spoolman_net`), since FDB
  stores gross (filament + reel tare) and Spoolman stores net (filament only).
- **`spoolWeight` on FDB filament creates uses the wizard-resolved tare**, not raw
  `sm.spool_weight` (which is often NULL). The resolved tare follows the same chain
  used to compute the spool gross weight: user tare override → spool `spool_weight` →
  filament `spool_weight` → 200 g default. This ensures `spoolWeight` matches the tare
  actually used for `totalWeight`, so Filament DB's % bar is accurate from first import.
- The Variances reconcile write-back is the only place the bridge *corrects existing*
  Spoolman filament data; all ongoing-sync writes are change-driven.
- **OpenTag weight-model bonus interacts with the weight model.** `spool_weight` is the
  empty-reel tare used in the net↔gross weight conversion (`spoolman_to_fdb_gross` /
  `fdb_to_spoolman_net`). Writing it from OPT container `emptyWeight` only happens via the
  user-confirmed OpenTag Apply flow (never automatically each cycle) and changes the tare
  used by subsequent weight syncs — but since the weight sync stores the *gross* on the FDB
  side and *net* on the SM side and refreshes both snapshots after each propagation, a tare
  change does not itself create a weight write or a ping-pong; it only affects the conversion
  applied to the *next* genuine weight change. `weight` (native, from package
  `nominalNettoFullWeight`) is the nominal full net weight and is not part of the
  conversion math.
- Cross-reference extras are always JSON-encoded via `encode_extra_value` / decoded via
  `decode_extra_value` — never written raw.
- **Stale cross-refs do not block spool creation.** A `filamentdb_spool_id` extra on a
  Spoolman spool only skips spool creation if that FDB spool id actually exists in the
  current FDB dataset. If the referenced spool is gone (DB wipe, deletion), the spool
  is treated as a new create and the stale cross-ref is overwritten on success.
