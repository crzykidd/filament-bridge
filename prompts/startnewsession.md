# Start-new-session prompt — filament-bridge

Paste/point me at this file at the start of a fresh session. It's a standing
onboarding brief (not a task — don't move it to `done/`). It restates the project and
the operating rules so a new session is productive even if conversation memory was
cleared.

## What this project is

**filament-bridge** is a bidirectional sync service between
[Filament DB](https://github.com/hyiger/filament-db) (Next.js/MongoDB, gross weight
model, MongoDB ObjectIds, spools embedded on filaments) and
[Spoolman](https://github.com/Donkie/Spoolman) (Python/FastAPI, net weight model,
relational Vendor→Filament→Spool with int IDs, extra-field system). It runs as a Docker
sidecar, polls both REST APIs, diffs against stored snapshots, applies non-conflicting
changes, and queues conflicts for manual resolution. **No upstream modifications** — only
documented REST APIs + Spoolman extra fields. Conflicts are never auto-resolved.

- **Stack:** Backend Python 3.12 / FastAPI, httpx, SQLAlchemy + SQLite, APScheduler,
  Pydantic v2. Frontend React 18 / TypeScript, Vite, Tailwind, React Router. Single
  Docker image (Node builds React → FastAPI serves it), single port 8090, SQLite in a
  mounted volume.
- **Cross-references:** Spoolman extra fields (`filamentdb_id`, `filamentdb_parent_id`,
  `filamentdb_spool_id`) link to FDB; FDB spool `label` stores the Spoolman spool id.
- **Variant model:** FDB has parent/variant inheritance (`parentId`, one level deep);
  Spoolman is flat one-filament-per-colour. The bridge tracks the parent via
  `filamentdb_parent_id`.

## Read first (in this order)

1. **`CLAUDE.md`** — the authoritative quick-reference (architecture decisions, env vars,
   runtime settings, weight/lifecycle/location sync rules, "what NOT to do").
2. **`docs/prd.md`** — full functional requirements (FR-numbers).
3. **`standards.md`** — the homelab standards this repo implements + pinned versions.
4. **`docs/decisions.md`** — the "why" log; check before re-deriving a design.
5. **`docs/backlog.md`** — the prioritised issue queue (GitHub issues are the source of
   truth; this file is the agreed order).

## Operating rules (honor these by default)

**Scope / what to work on**
- **Only work the bug(s)/issue(s) the user explicitly names.** Never fan out to the
  backlog, pick up other open issues, or add "while I'm here" fixes on your own. Offer
  others as a one-liner at most, then wait.
- For substantial *named* implementation work, prefer **dispatching to a Sonnet
  subagent** (Agent tool, `model: sonnet`, `isolation: "worktree"` when parallel); Opus
  orchestrates, reviews the diff, and integrates. Don't dispatch unnamed work.

**Git / check-in (the `code-checkin-and-pr` standard)**
- **Commit, but do not push** without explicit OK — even to `dev`. *Exception:*
  invoking `/release-prep` or `/release-cut` authorizes that command's own push.
- **Never push to `main`** (protected). Changes land via a `dev → main` PR with all
  required checks green. Day-to-day work is on `dev` (or a short branch off it).
- **Conventional-commit prefixes** (`feat:`/`fix:`/`chore:`/`docs:`). **No
  `Co-authored-by:` trailers.** **Docs ship in the same commit as the code** they
  describe. Never bypass hooks (`--no-verify` etc.).
- Branch-protection required checks use **bare names** (`Lint`, `Test`, …), not
  `CI / Lint`.

**Issue tracking / auto-close**
- **Every commit that resolves a tracked issue ends its body with `Fixes #N`** (one per
  issue it closes) — whether the issue was named by the user or filed from chat. This is
  required for traceability, not optional.
- For a bug reported **in chat with no GitHub issue** — **or any major issue/bug we
  discover during work** — `gh issue create` a full issue first, then reference it with
  `Fixes #N` in the fix commit body so it closes with the fix. **If you're unsure whether
  something warrants its own issue, ASK** — don't silently skip it or silently file it.
- In the **release PR body**, add one closing keyword **per issue** (`Fixes #22`,
  `fixes #26`, `fixes #31`) — keywords do NOT distribute across a list, and a squash
  merge discards commit trailers, so **the PR body is the reliable closer** (the commit
  `Fixes #N` is for traceability; the PR body is what actually auto-closes on merge).
- The CHANGELOG/release-notes entry for each issue should also name it (e.g. `Closes #36`
  / `Fixes #13`) so the issue ↔ release mapping is visible in the notes.
- For an already-closed issue lacking a version note, add a "Fixed in vX.Y.Z" comment.

**Testing (run before committing)**
- Backend: `cd backend && .venv/bin/python -m pytest` (the venv python; bare `python`
  isn't on PATH). Lint: `.venv/bin/python -m ruff check backend/`.
- Frontend: `cd frontend && npx vitest run` and `npx tsc --noEmit`.

**Releases (the `release-prep-and-cut` standard)**
- Version is stored **bare** in `backend/app/__init__.py` (`__version__`) and mirrored to
  the README badge + What's New + `CHANGELOG.md`. The `v` prefix is added in exactly one
  place: the git tag / GitHub release (done by `/release-cut`).
- `CHANGELOG.md` `## [Unreleased]` is the single source of release notes; the release PR
  body and the GitHub release body reuse the same section verbatim.
- Flow: `/release-prep <version>` (bump + roll changelog + sync docs + one
  `chore(release):` commit + push dev + open PR) → human merges + CI green + `:latest`
  published → `/release-cut <version>` (tag + GitHub release, which triggers the
  production image build). Never re-tag; pick the next version instead.

**Other standards**
- `repo-sandbox-permissions` (repo-wide): in-repo reads/edits/writes/bash run sandboxed;
  widen `allowedDomains`/`allowWrite` rather than adding `Bash(...)` allow rules.
- `handoff-prompt-workflow`: scoped tasks live in `prompts/` (from `TEMPLATE.md`),
  completed → `prompts/done/`; log non-obvious decisions in `docs/decisions.md`.

## ⏸️ PICK UP HERE (paused 2026-07-19 overnight — READY FOR `/release-prep 0.6.16`)

**FIRST THING THIS MORNING: run `/release-prep 0.6.16`.** A batch of work is committed +
pushed on `dev` (HEAD **`7313d0a`**, `dev` == `origin/dev`, clean tree) with a full
`CHANGELOG [Unreleased]` section, all tests green (backend 1436 + ruff; frontend 189 + tsc).
Nothing stranded. Latest release is still **v0.6.15**; this next one is **0.6.16**.

**What's queued in `[Unreleased]` for 0.6.16:**
- **#72** (Fixed) — Conflicts "Add" (FDB→Spoolman) now **requires** the empty-reel (tare)
  weight when the FDB filament has none, **uses** it (the tare was being silently dropped),
  and **writes it back** to the FDB filament. Backend gate (422 `tare_required`) + frontend
  required-field. Commit `56271c2`.
- **#73** (Performance/Fixed, *partial* — see open items) — three prod perf/reliability wins:
  (a) **Sync Log** no longer re-fetches the whole Spoolman catalog per load (lazy + 60s cache);
  (b) **DB indexes** added (6 across migrations `d4e6f8a1b3c5` + `e5f7a2c4b6d8`:
  `sync_log.timestamp`/`cycle_id`, `conflicts.resolved_at`, `filament_mappings.filamentdb_id`,
  `spool_mappings.filament_mapping_id` + `.filamentdb_spool_id`); (c) **"Sync now" 500** now
  returns a structured, diagnosable error (+ a global 500 handler). Commits `fc88314`, `7313d0a`.
- **Prod leftover (still there, inert):** orphan Spoolman filament **#179** + stale mapping
  `179→<master>` on `spoolman.crzynet.com` — harmless; the #70 GC clears it when 179 is deleted.

**Open / next work (ask the user which to take):**
- **#73 remaining** — **Dashboard (5-10s)** double filament N+1 in `/sync/status` + sequential
  health checks; and if "Sync now" is *timing out* (not erroring), consider backgrounding the
  blocking cycle. Issue left OPEN with a progress comment.
- **#74** — label print: add FDB `spool_id` **and** the FDB full `name` as selectable label
  fields (`_build_field_catalog` in `app/api/labels.py`).
- **#65** — SM→FDB latent preview-writes bug (same class as #64; needs real `dry_run` on the
  bigger `_execute_spoolman_to_fdb`).

**The FDB→Spoolman import saga — ALL SHIPPED:** importing a Filament DB master+variant into
Spoolman was broken in stacked layers, fixed one per release:
- **#61** (v0.6.12): create payload omitted required `diameter`/`density` → 422; also skip
  synthetic "masters" (they don't sync to Spoolman's flat model).
- **#62** (v0.6.12): auto-sync PATCHed null `density`/`diameter` → 422 every cycle.
- **#64** (v0.6.13): the Conflicts "Add" **preview was writing to Spoolman** (dry-run called
  the real importer, only rolled back SQLite). Real `dry_run` mode added. **#65 still OPEN** —
  the SM→FDB direction has the same latent preview-writes bug (masked by find-or-attach;
  needs the same `dry_run` on the bigger `_execute_spoolman_to_fdb`).
- **#67** (v0.6.14): filament created without `weight` → Spoolman rejected the spool
  (`remaining_weight` needs a filament weight) → 400. weight = max(netFilamentWeight, largest
  spool net) so overfilled spools aren't clamped; self-heals weight-less filaments on re-import.
- **#69** (v0.6.15): the selectable-import UI (per-record "create in Spoolman" checkbox).
- **#70** (v0.6.15): adding a filament crashed with `UNIQUE constraint failed:
  filament_mappings.spoolman_filament_id`. Root cause = **Spoolman reuses deleted integer ids**
  (SQLite rowid, no AUTOINCREMENT), so a stale bridge mapping left by an earlier orphan-cleanup
  collided with a freshly-created filament handed the reused id. Two-part fix: (1) the FDB→SM
  create path clears a stale mapping on the just-minted id; (2) root cause — the sync cycle
  **purges a filament mapping the cycle its Spoolman filament is deleted**
  (`_purge_stale_filament_mappings` in engine.py). Deliberately does NOT auto-purge on identity
  mismatch (would false-positive on user-renamed filaments). See decisions.md 2026-07-19.

## Current state (update as it moves)

- Latest release: **v0.6.15** (2026-07-19) — #69 selectable FDB import + #70 reused-id crash
  fix / stale-mapping GC + **FDB 1.67.0** latest-tested bump (reviewed, no bridge-affecting
  changes). Chain: v0.6.14 (#67 spool-create 400), v0.6.13 (#64 preview-writes), v0.6.12
  (#61 diameter-422 + #62 null-scalar-PATCH). Earlier: v0.6.11 (repo audit — see below),
  v0.6.10 (Synced Records Unlink #40 *partial*; net/gross labels #55), v0.6.9 (mobile
  printer-slot #53; OpenTag clarity #52).
- **Queued on `dev` for 0.6.16** (unreleased, see the PICK-UP block): **#72** tare-required
  Add fix; **#73** *partial* (Sync Log speed + DB indexes + Sync-now 500 diagnosability).
- Open issues (see `docs/backlog.md`): **#73** *remaining* — Dashboard N+1 + (maybe) background
  the blocking "Sync now"; **#74** label print add FDB `spool_id` + full `name` fields; **#65**
  SM→FDB preview-writes (same class as #64); **#40** RELINK in Synced Records (Unlink shipped
  v0.6.10; relink needs a `filament-suggestions-by-mapping` endpoint + ranked picker); **#47**
  read-only API token (design call); **#24** Discord webhooks (FR-20); **#25** print-history
  enrichment (FR-22, deferred). (#69 + #70 closed in v0.6.15.)
- **Branch-tangle gotcha:** `/release-cut` leaves you on `main`; if you then commit, it lands
  on local `main` by mistake. After any release-cut, `git checkout dev` and
  `git branch -f main origin/main` before doing more work (happened 3× this session).
- Live prod inspection: see the `prod-bridge-instance` memory (URL + read-only API-token
  auth) and `get-only-on-production` (GET-only; the shared token is full read-write). The
  test upstreams `crzydev.home.arpa:3000` (FDB) / `:7912` (SM) are writable and were used for
  e2e — clean up any `zzz-*` test records you create.

## 2026-07-02 repo audit — shipped in v0.6.11

A three-track audit (security / Claude-token-efficiency / docs) run on 2026-07-02 and
shipped **in full** in v0.6.11. Detail lives in `docs/decisions.md` (2026-07-02 entries)
and the CHANGELOG v0.6.11 section. Summary:

- **Security:** backup secret boundary — export/import no longer leak/accept auth secrets
  (#57); proxy-aware cookie `Secure` flag (`_is_https` reads `X-Forwarded-Proto`) + uvicorn
  `--proxy-headers` + response security headers (#58); per-IP in-memory login rate-limiting
  (5 attempts → 429 + Retry-After, 5-min cooldown) (#59). **M3 accepted-risk/won't-fix:**
  plaintext secrets in SQLite are a deliberate tradeoff for the single-admin self-hosted
  model (decisions.md). Audit verified good: bcrypt+salt, timing-safe compare,
  HttpOnly+SameSite=lax cookie, `/r/` open-redirect + SPA path-traversal defenses, no raw
  SQL, no XSS sinks, non-root container.
- **Token efficiency:** CLAUDE.md slimmed 47k → 12k bytes (~75%) by moving reference
  material behind pointers; new `docs/upstream-apis.md`; `docs/decisions.md` got a
  topic-grouped index at the top — **regenerate it with `scripts/gen-decisions-index.py`
  after adding a `## ` entry (and add the heading to that script's `CATEGORIES`)**;
  `rehype-slug` wired into the in-app DocsViewer so anchors jump.
- **Docs:** security.md corrected (session lifetime via `mobile_session_days`, full
  public-routes list, the `mobile_session_days=0` public-mode exposure); new
  `docs/reconcile.md` + `docs/tare-editor.md`; orphan-spool pass row in sync-model.md;
  conflicts.md relink claim fixed; added `CONTRIBUTING.md` + `SECURITY.md`.
- **Still open (not an issue yet):** a troubleshooting/FAQ doc was scoped but not written.

## How to start a session

1. Read the docs above.
2. Ask me (the user) which bug/issue to work — then work only that.
3. Make the change with tests + docs in the same commit; run the test commands; **stop
   and ask before pushing.**
