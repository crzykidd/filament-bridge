# Task: <short imperative title>

<One or two sentences: what this task accomplishes and why.>

## Before you start

- <Docs to read first / conventions to match.>
- <Constraints — paths come from host-paths.md, map-not-copy, etc.>

## Working tree check

Before making any edits, run `git status --porcelain` and cross-reference the files
this plan needs to modify. If any of those files have uncommitted changes, list them
and ask the user before touching them. Surface unrelated dirty files once as
awareness; don't block. This file (the handoff prompt itself) is exempt — it's
expected to be modified by "When done" below.

## What to do

1. <Step.>
2. <Step.>

## Conventions to honor

- <Style / structure / changelog expectations.>

## When done

1. Update this file's frontmatter: set `status` (completed/failed), `completed` (the
   date), and `result` (one line).
2. `git mv` this file into `prompts/done/` (on success) or `prompts/failed/` (on
   failure). Create the subdir if it doesn't exist yet.
3. Record any non-obvious decisions in the project's `docs/decisions.md`.
4. Propose ONE commit covering the files this session modified (including the prompt
   move). Present the file list and a one-line message summarising the changes; ask
   `commit these as "<message>"? (y/n)`. On `y`, stage those specific paths and
   commit on the current branch. Never `git add -A`. Never push. By default the
   message is a plain one-liner and the branch is whatever the session is on. **Only
   if** the project also adopts `code-checkin-and-pr` do its branch rules (`dev`,
   never `main`) and commit-prefix conventions (`feat:` / `fix:` / `chore:` /
   `docs:`, no `Co-authored-by:`) apply on top.
