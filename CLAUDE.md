# CLAUDE.md

## Project overview

filament-bridge is a bidirectional sync service between [Filament DB](https://github.com/hyiger/filament-db) and [Spoolman](https://github.com/Donkie/Spoolman) for 3D printing filament management. It runs as a Docker sidecar alongside both systems, keeps their databases in sync, and handles conflict resolution.

**Read `docs/prd.md` before writing any code.** It contains the full functional requirements, prioritization (P0/P1/P2), data flow diagrams, and open questions. This file is the quick-reference; the PRD is the spec.

## Standards

This project adopts engineering standards from the crzynet `homelab-configs` repo. **Read [`standards.md`](standards.md) at session start** whenever the work could touch branching, commits, PRs, releases, or handoff prompts — it lists every standard and the pinned version this repo actually implements. The hard per-session rules are inlined below; the rest is linked, not restated.

<!--

### Code check-in (operational rules)

This project adopts the `code-checkin-and-pr` standard. The full why-and-how lives at
the source above; the rules below are the per-session do/don'ts a coding agent must
honor by default:

- **Never push directly to `main`.** `main` is protected. All changes land via a pull
  request from `dev` → `main`, and only when every required check is green.
- **Day-to-day work happens on `dev`** (or a short-lived branch off `dev`). Push to
  `dev` freely.
- **Commit message prefixes are required** — Conventional-Commits style:
  - `feat:` — new user-facing feature
  - `fix:` — bug fix
  - `chore:` — config, tooling, dependencies, maintenance
  - `docs:` — documentation-only changes
- **Do not add `Co-authored-by:` trailers** unless the user explicitly asks.
- **Doc updates ship in the same commit as the code they describe** — never as a
  follow-up commit.
- **Never bypass hooks** (no `--no-verify`, `--no-gpg-sign`, etc.) unless the user
  explicitly asks. If a hook fails, fix the underlying issue.
- **Stable releases are tagged from `main` only.** Don't tag from `dev`.

If you're unsure whether an action would violate one of the above, stop and ask before
acting.

steps, adoption checklist) lives at:

-->

### Release process (operational rules)

This project adopts the `release-prep-and-cut` standard. The full why-and-how
lives at the source above; the rules below are the per-session do/don'ts a
coding agent must honor by default:

- **The version is stored BARE in the source-of-truth file** — no `v` prefix
  anywhere in code. The `v` prefix is added in exactly one place: the git tag
  and matching GitHub release name. Don't add it to README badges, CHANGELOG
  headers, in-code image tags, or anywhere else.
- **`CHANGELOG.md` is the single source of truth for release notes.** The PR
  description (set by `/release-prep`) and the GitHub release body (set by
  `/release-cut`) reuse the **same section verbatim**. Never author release
  notes twice.
- **One commit per release prep.** Version bump + changelog roll + every doc
  sync ship in a single `chore(release): prepare v<version>` commit. No
  `Co-authored-by:` trailers.
- **Never re-tag.** If `v<version>` already exists as a local tag, a remote
  tag, or a GitHub release, STOP. Never delete-and-recreate; never `--force`.
  Pick the next version instead.
- **`/release-cut` only after the PR has merged and CI is green.** The
  publish-to-`main` workflow must have already pushed `:latest` images to the
  registry before `/release-cut` runs. If you cannot confirm both — STOP and
  tell the user to wait.
- **The release tag is the only thing the cut command writes to `main`.** Both
  the prep commit and any follow-up docs commit land on `dev` and reach `main`
  only via PR. Never push directly to `main` as part of a release.

If you're unsure whether an action would violate one of the above, stop and
ask before acting.

### Sandbox permissions

This project adopts the
[`repo-sandbox-permissions`](https://gitea.crzynet.com/crzynet/homelab-configs/src/branch/main/standards/repo-sandbox-permissions/README.md)
standard — **scope: repo-wide** (`.claude/settings.json`). Routine in-repo file reads,
edits, writes, and bash commands run sandboxed without prompts; writes outside the repo
and network access stay gated (registries allow-listed in `allowedDomains`). The model is
**confinement, not command-guessing** — don't add `Bash(...)` allow/deny patterns to work
around a prompt; if a command needs to escape the box, widen the sandbox's
`allowedDomains`/`allowWrite` instead. The pinned version + filled-in scope live in
`standards.md`; no `CLAUDE-snippet.md` is shipped for this standard.

### Handoff prompts

This project follows the
[`handoff-prompt-workflow`](https://gitea.crzynet.com/crzynet/homelab-configs/src/branch/main/standards/handoff-prompt-workflow/README.md)
standard for scoped work: plan → decide → execute → document. Pending tasks live in
`prompts/` (one file per task, from `prompts/TEMPLATE.md`); completed ones move to
`prompts/done/` (or `prompts/failed/`). Non-obvious decisions get logged in
[`docs/decisions.md`](docs/decisions.md). See the standard for the full why.

## Key concepts

- **Filament DB** — Next.js 14 / MongoDB app for filament profile management, slicer integration, calibrations, NFC tags. REST API at `/api/`. Spools are embedded subdocuments on filament records (not a separate collection). Uses MongoDB ObjectIds (24-char hex). Weight model is GROSS (filament + reel tare). API is unauthenticated. [API docs](https://github.com/hyiger/filament-db/blob/main/docs/api.md)
- **Spoolman** — Python/FastAPI app for spool inventory tracking with native OctoPrint/Moonraker integration. REST API at `/api/v1/`. Relational model: Vendor → Filament → Spool with auto-increment integer IDs. Weight model is NET (filament only, reel excluded). Extra fields system for custom data on any entity. API is unauthenticated. [API docs](https://donkie.github.io/Spoolman/)
- **Minimum supported versions** — Filament DB **≥ 1.33.0** (multicolor/finish-tag/temperature sync) and Spoolman **≥ 0.22.0** (multi-color fields + stable extra fields). Defined in `core/version.py` (`MIN_FDB`, `MIN_SPOOLMAN`). When a *known* upstream version is below its minimum, **sync is hard-gated**: `run_sync_cycle`, the sync trigger/dry-run endpoints, and the wizard execute all refuse with "Sync disabled — upgrade … to use", and auto-sync cycles are skipped. The bridge still starts and the UI/health load (a warning is surfaced). An unknown/unreadable version does NOT block (that's a connectivity concern, handled by health `degraded`).
- **Sync engine** — polls both APIs on a configurable interval, diffs state against last snapshot, applies non-conflicting changes, queues conflicts for manual resolution.
- **Cross-reference IDs** — Spoolman extra fields (`filamentdb_id`, `filamentdb_parent_id`, `filamentdb_spool_id`) link to Filament DB. Filament DB spool `label` field (configurable) stores Spoolman spool ID.
- **Variant model** — Filament DB has parent/variant inheritance via `parentId` field (one parent, multiple color variants, one level deep only). Spoolman has flat one-filament-per-color. Bridge tracks the parent relationship via `filamentdb_parent_id` extra field in Spoolman.

## Architecture decisions

- **No upstream modifications** — bridge only uses documented REST APIs and Spoolman's extra field system. Never fork or patch Filament DB or Spoolman.
- **Three-phase sync** — Bulk Import Wizard (re-runnable) → validation dry run → user-enabled auto-sync. Auto-sync is OFF by default and requires explicit user action to enable.
- **Conflicts are never auto-resolved** — queued for human decision with optional Discord notification. This is a hard rule — do not implement silent conflict resolution.
- **Weight decrements from Spoolman create usage log entries in Filament DB** (via `POST /api/filaments/:id/spools/:spoolId/usage`), never raw weight overwrites. This preserves Filament DB's usage history audit trail.
- **Sync direction and conflict policy are user-configurable** per data category via Settings (two independent axes: `direction` and `conflict_policy`). Resolved by `core/sync_policy.py:resolve_sync_action`. The Bulk Import Wizard captures the initial import direction only; the ongoing two-axis model lives in Settings.
- **Configuration via environment variables** — service refuses to start without required vars (`FILAMENTDB_URL`, `SPOOLMAN_URL`). No config file. No database-stored config for connection URLs.
- **Never delete records** in either upstream system without explicit user action in the bridge UI.

## Tech stack

- **Backend:** Python 3.12+ / FastAPI, httpx for async API clients, SQLAlchemy + SQLite for sync state, APScheduler for sync intervals, Pydantic v2 for data models and API response validation
- **Frontend:** React 18+ / TypeScript, Vite build tooling, Tailwind CSS, React Router for navigation
- **Deployment:** Docker multi-stage build (Node builds React → Python serves FastAPI + static assets from `/static`), single container, single port (default 8090), SQLite database in a mounted volume at `/data/bridge.db`

## Environment variables

| Variable | Required | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `FILAMENTDB_URL` | **Yes** | — | Base URL of Filament DB (e.g., `http://filament-db:3000`) |
| `SPOOLMAN_URL` | **Yes** | — | Base URL of Spoolman (e.g., `http://spoolman:7912`) |
| `FILAMENTDB_API_KEY` | No | — | Bearer token for Filament DB's optional API-key auth (FDB ≥ 1.39.0, set via FDB's own `FILAMENTDB_API_KEY`). When set, the bridge sends `Authorization: Bearer <key>` on every Filament DB request. Empty = no auth header (FDB API unauthenticated). Spoolman's API has no auth. |
| `SYNC_INTERVAL_SECONDS` | No | `120` | Seconds between auto-sync cycles (also runtime-editable via Settings) |
| `BACKUP_SCHEDULE_ENABLED` | No | `true` | Master switch for the nightly scheduled backup job (FR-24b). Runtime-editable via Settings (DB value wins, same precedence as the interval). |
| `BACKUP_BRIDGE_STATE_ENABLED` | No | `true` | Include the bridge-state export (`GET /backup/export` payload) in the nightly backup. Runtime-editable. |
| `BACKUP_FILAMENTDB_ENABLED` | No | `true` | Include the Filament DB snapshot (`GET /api/snapshot`) in the nightly backup. Runtime-editable. Spoolman is deliberately NOT scheduled (the bridge can't prune Spoolman's own volume). |
| `BACKUP_RETENTION_DAYS` | No | `7` | Delete bridge-written backups in `{DATA_DIR}/backups/` older than this (matches the `bridge-state-`/`filamentdb-snapshot-` prefixes only). Runtime-editable; min 1. |
| `BACKUP_HOUR_UTC` | No | `3` | UTC hour (0–23) the nightly backup runs at, minute 0. Runtime-editable; rescheduled on save. |
| `PUID` | No | `1000` | User ID the container process runs as (entrypoint chowns `/data` then drops to this UID) |
| `PGID` | No | `1000` | Group ID the container process runs as |
| `SPOOLMAN_FIELD_FILAMENTDB_ID` | No | `filamentdb_id` | Spoolman extra field name for Filament DB filament ID |
| `SPOOLMAN_FIELD_FILAMENTDB_PARENT_ID` | No | `filamentdb_parent_id` | Spoolman extra field for parent filament ID |
| `SPOOLMAN_FIELD_FILAMENTDB_SPOOL_ID` | No | `filamentdb_spool_id` | Spoolman extra field for spool subdocument ID |
| `FILAMENTDB_SPOOLMAN_ID_FIELD` | No | `label` | Filament DB spool field to store Spoolman spool ID |
| `FIELD_MAPPINGS` | No | — | Comma-separated `fdb_field=spoolman_field` pairs |
| `FIELD_MAPPING_EXCLUDES` | No | — | Comma-separated field names to exclude from auto-match |
| `VARIANT_LINE_KEYWORDS` | No | (seed list) | Comma-separated words marking distinct variant lines (e.g. `silk,matte,rapid`). Filaments whose names match different keywords won't be grouped together. Overridable at runtime via Settings. |
| `SPOOLMAN_FIELD_FILAMENTDB_MATERIAL_TAGS` | No | `filamentdb_material_tags` | Spoolman filament-level extra field storing finish-tag IDs (CSV string of ints, e.g. `16,17`) |
| `MATERIAL_TAG_IDS` | No | (seed list) | CSV of `keyword=id` pairs overriding the default keyword→OpenPrintTag-ID map for finish detection. Empty = use seed defaults from `core/material_tags.py`. |
| `OPENTAG_VENDOR_ALIASES` | No | — | CSV of `spoolman_vendor=opentag_brand` pairs for OpenTag brand pre-filter (e.g. `prusa=prusament`). Normalised on both sides; blank = no aliases. Overridable at runtime via Settings. |
| `SPOOLMAN_FIELD_OPENPRINTTAG_SLUG` | No | `openprinttag_slug` | Spoolman filament extra field for the OpenPrintTag material slug |
| `SPOOLMAN_FIELD_OPENPRINTTAG_UUID` | No | `openprinttag_uuid` | Spoolman filament extra field for the OpenPrintTag material UUID |
| `SPOOLMAN_FIELD_OPENPRINTTAG_IGNORE` | No | `openprinttag_ignore` | Spoolman filament extra field storing the "ignore future updates" flag (`"1"` = ignored, `""` = not ignored). Written by the Updates Review UI. |
| `SPOOLMAN_FIELD_OPENPRINTTAG_NOZZLE_TEMP_MIN` | No | `openprinttag_nozzle_temp_min` | Spoolman filament **integer** extra field for OPT `nozzleTempMin` (°C). Synced ↔ FDB `temperatures.nozzleRangeMin`. |
| `SPOOLMAN_FIELD_OPENPRINTTAG_NOZZLE_TEMP_MAX` | No | `openprinttag_nozzle_temp_max` | Spoolman filament **integer** extra field for OPT `nozzleTempMax` (°C). Synced ↔ FDB `temperatures.nozzleRangeMax`. |
| `SPOOLMAN_FIELD_OPENPRINTTAG_DRYING_TEMP` | No | `openprinttag_drying_temp` | Spoolman filament **integer** extra field for OPT `dryingTemp` (°C). Synced ↔ FDB `dryingTemperature`. |
| `SPOOLMAN_FIELD_OPENPRINTTAG_DRYING_TIME` | No | `openprinttag_drying_time` | Spoolman filament **integer** extra field for drying time in **hours**. OPT stores minutes; the OpenTag Apply flow converts ÷60. Synced ↔ FDB `dryingTime` (hours). |
| `SPOOLMAN_FIELD_OPENPRINTTAG_HARDNESS_SHORE_A` | No | `openprinttag_hardness_shore_a` | Spoolman filament **float** extra field for OPT `hardnessShoreA`. Synced ↔ FDB `shoreHardnessA`. |
| `SPOOLMAN_FIELD_OPENPRINTTAG_HARDNESS_SHORE_D` | No | `openprinttag_hardness_shore_d` | Spoolman filament **float** extra field for OPT `hardnessShoreD`. Synced ↔ FDB `shoreHardnessD`. |
| `SPOOLMAN_FIELD_OPENPRINTTAG_TRANSMISSION_DISTANCE` | No | `openprinttag_transmission_distance` | Spoolman filament **float** extra field for OPT `transmissionDistance` (mm). Synced ↔ FDB `transmissionDistance`. |
| `OPENTAG_CACHE_MAX_AGE_HOURS` | No | `24` | Hours before the local OpenTag dataset cache is considered stale |
| `CONTAINER_PARENT_MARKER` | No | `(Master)` | String appended (after a space) to generic-container parent names in the wizard. Empty string = no suffix. Overridable at runtime via Settings. |
| `BRIDGE_CHANNEL` | No | `release` | Build channel baked in at image build time (Docker build arg `BUILD_CHANNEL`). When `dev`, the displayed version gets a `-dev` suffix (+ short commit). |
| `BRIDGE_COMMIT` | No | — | Short git SHA baked in at image build time (Docker build arg `GIT_COMMIT`). Shown in version label on dev builds. |
| `DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL` | No | — | Discord webhook for conflict/error notifications (declared; not yet implemented) |
| `AUTH_ENABLED` | No | `true` | When `false`, auth is fully bypassed (open app). Set to `false` for locked-out recovery: disable → change password in Settings → re-enable. |
| `LOG_LEVEL` | No | `info` | Logging level (debug, info, warn, error) |
| `DATA_DIR` | No | `/data` | Directory for SQLite database and backup files |
| `DEBUG_STARTUP_DUMP` | No | `false` | When `true`, writes a human-readable snapshot of both upstream systems at boot to `{DATA_DIR}/state-dumps/startup-state-<UTC ts>.txt`. Newest 10 dumps are kept. Never enable in production. |
| `CHANGES_LOG_ENABLED` | No | `true` | When `false`, disables the durable changes.log file. |
| `CHANGES_LOG_PATH` | No | `{DATA_DIR}/changes.log` | Override the path for the changes.log file. |

### Runtime-editable settings (BridgeConfig)

Several settings can be changed at runtime via the Settings UI (stored in SQLite, env vars are the start-up fallback):

| Setting | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `sync_interval_seconds` | env fallback (`120`) | Auto-sync interval; applied immediately on save |
| `new_filament_policy` | `manual_review` | What the engine does when it detects an unmapped filament: `manual_review` queues an actionable `new_filament` conflict; `auto_import` creates it immediately using the wizard code path. Falls back to `manual_review` if `variant_parent_mode` is `unset` and the filament looks like a variant-cluster member. |
| `new_spool_policy` | `manual_review` | What the engine does when an unmapped spool appears on an already-mapped filament: `manual_review` queues a `new_spool` conflict; `auto_import` creates it immediately. A spool is always held when its filament is unmapped, regardless of this setting. |
| `debug_mode` | `false` | Enables `POST /api/debug/clear-spoolman-fdb-refs`, `POST /api/debug/reset-bridge-state`, and `POST /api/debug/full-reset` (403 when off) |
| `never_import_empties` | `false` | **Import-only** (UI label: "Skip empty & archived spools on import"). Wizard + ongoing new-spool import skip spools with zero remaining weight or that are archived, at preview/execute. Does NOT affect ongoing archive/retire lifecycle mirroring for already-mapped pairs (that runs regardless). Config key unchanged. |
| `archive_sync_direction` | `two_way` | Direction for the archive/retire lifecycle category (`two_way` / `spoolman_to_filamentdb` / `filamentdb_to_spoolman`). Mirrors SM `archived` ↔ FDB `retired` for already-mapped spool pairs. |
| `archive_conflict_policy` | `manual` | Conflict policy for the archive/retire category (consulted only under `two_way` when both sides diverge to opposite states): `manual` / `spoolman_wins` / `filamentdb_wins`. `newest_wins` is rejected at the API (422) — the state is a boolean with no timestamp. |
| `sync_log_retention_days` | `30` | Sync log entries older than this are pruned automatically |
| `backup_schedule_enabled` | env fallback (`true`) | Master switch for the nightly scheduled backup job (FR-24b). When off, the `nightly_backup` cron is a no-op. |
| `backup_bridge_state_enabled` | env fallback (`true`) | Include the bridge-state export in the nightly backup. |
| `backup_filamentdb_enabled` | env fallback (`true`) | Include the Filament DB snapshot in the nightly backup. Spoolman is intentionally excluded (no prune control). |
| `backup_retention_days` | env fallback (`7`) | Delete bridge-written backups (`bridge-state-`/`filamentdb-snapshot-` prefixes) in `{DATA_DIR}/backups/` older than this. Min 1; rejected with the error envelope otherwise. |
| `backup_hour_utc` | env fallback (`3`) | UTC hour (0–23) the nightly backup fires at, minute 0. Validated 0..23; the cron is rescheduled on save. |
| `variant_parent_mode` | `unset` | Wizard variant hierarchy mode: `unset` (must choose), `promote_color` (original behavior), or `generic_container` (colorless container parent for every cluster). See `docs/variant-parent-mode.md`. |
| `api_token_enabled` | `false` | When `true`, requests may authenticate via `Authorization: Bearer <token>` or `X-API-Key`. Toggle in Settings → Security. |
| `api_token` | (none) | The API token value — stored in BridgeConfig so Settings can display it. Regenerate via Settings → Security → Regenerate token. |
| `opentag_vendor_aliases` | env fallback (`""`) | CSV of `sm=opentag` vendor alias pairs for the OpenTag matcher brand pre-filter. |
| `container_parent_marker` | env fallback (`"(Master)"`) | String appended to generic-container parent names (e.g. "ELEGOO PLA (Master)"). Empty = no suffix. Shown in Settings when `generic_container` mode is active. |

## Important technical details

### Weight model translation
Spoolman `remaining_weight` is net filament. Filament DB `totalWeight` is gross (filament + reel). The filament-level `spoolWeight` field is the empty reel tare weight.
- Spoolman → Filament DB: `totalWeight = remaining_weight + spoolWeight`
- Filament DB → Spoolman: `remaining_weight = totalWeight - spoolWeight`
  **DO NOT also subtract `sum(usageHistory.grams)`.** Filament DB reduces `totalWeight`
  directly when a usage entry is logged (verified against the live API: a 10 g usage drops
  `totalWeight` by 10 *and* appends to `usageHistory`), so `totalWeight` is already the
  *current* gross. Subtracting usage on top of that double-counts it — that, combined with
  one-sided snapshot refreshes, caused a runaway compounding weight-decrement loop in two-way
  sync (fixed 2026-06-10; see `docs/decisions.md`). `usageHistory` is an audit trail only.
- Weight decrements from Spoolman are logged as usage entries in Filament DB with `source: "spoolman"`
- Weight increases (user added filament, correction) should update totalWeight directly, not create negative usage entries
- **After any weight propagation the engine must refresh BOTH side snapshots to the post-write
  agreed values** (SM `remaining_weight` and FDB `totalWeight`), or the propagated change is
  re-detected as a fresh change on the other side next cycle → ping-pong.

### Archive/retire lifecycle sync
Archive/retire lifecycle state mirrors **bidirectionally for already-mapped spool pairs**:
SM `archived` ↔ FDB `retired`. A dedicated lifecycle pass runs **after** the weight pass on
purpose — a spool is usually archived right as it hits ~0 g, so the final weight decrement
(and its FDB usage-log entry) must settle and both snapshots refresh *before* the archive
bit mirrors, or the far side lands retired/archived with a stale weight and a missing usage
entry. One-sided flips (either direction, archive or un-archive) are clean pushes; only a
both-sides-flip-to-opposite-states divergence queues a `cross_system` conflict
(`field_name="lifecycle"`). Governed by the `archive_sync` category (`archive_sync_direction`
/ `archive_conflict_policy`). The wizard import gate (`never_import_empties`) still keeps
*unmapped* archived spools out of auto-import — only mapped pairs are mirrored. After any
lifecycle push, refresh BOTH snapshots (same anti-ping-pong rule as weight).

### Filament DB API endpoints the bridge uses
- `GET /api/filaments` — list all filaments with embedded spools
- `GET /api/filaments/:id` — single filament with full detail
- `POST /api/filaments` — create filament (set `parentId` for variants)
- `PUT /api/filaments/:id` — update filament properties
- `GET /api/spools/export-csv` — all active spools with labels, weights, locations
- `POST /api/spools/import` — bulk spool CSV import (columns: filament, vendor, totalWeight, label, lotNumber, location)
- `POST /api/filaments/:id/spools` — add a single spool to a filament
- `PUT /api/filaments/:id/spools/:spoolId` — update spool properties
- `POST /api/filaments/:id/spools/:spoolId/usage` — log usage `{ grams, jobLabel, source, date }`
- `POST /api/print-history` — log print job with multi-spool usage array
- `GET /api/filaments/:id/spool-check?weight=N` — check if spool has enough filament
- `GET /api/locations` — list locations (add `?stats=true` for spool counts/grams)
- `PUT /api/locations/:id` — update location properties (e.g., humidity)
- `DELETE /api/filaments/:id` — soft-delete only (sets `_deletedAt`)

### Spoolman API endpoints the bridge uses
- `GET /api/v1/spool?limit=1000` — list spools (MUST set limit, default paginates)
- `GET /api/v1/spool/{id}` — single spool with nested filament and vendor
- `PATCH /api/v1/spool/{id}` — update spool (remaining_weight, extra fields, location, etc.)
- `POST /api/v1/spool` — create spool (requires filament_id)
- `GET /api/v1/filament` — list filaments with nested vendor
- `GET /api/v1/filament/{id}` — single filament
- `POST /api/v1/filament` — create filament
- `GET /api/v1/vendor` — list vendors
- `POST /api/v1/vendor` — create vendor
- `GET /api/v1/export/spools?fmt=csv` — CSV export (all spools, no pagination limit)
- `PUT /api/v1/spool/{id}/use` — decrement weight (used by OctoPrint/Moonraker, NOT by bridge)
- Note: archived spools are EXCLUDED from `/api/v1/spool` by default. Pass `?allow_archived=true` to include them (returns active + archived in one listing). There is NO `archived` filter param — an unknown `?archived=true` is silently ignored and returns the active-only list (this once hid archived spools from the bridge, making archived mapped spools look deleted).

### Filament DB data model gotchas
- Spools are embedded subdocuments in the `spools[]` array on the filament document — there is no standalone spool collection or endpoint. Every spool operation goes through `/api/filaments/:filamentId/spools/:spoolId`.
- No spool label lookup endpoint — to find a spool by label, fetch all filaments or use the CSV export and filter client-side.
- Variant deletion is blocked (400) if the parent still has variants — must remove/reassign variants first.
- `DELETE /api/filaments/:id` is a soft-delete (sets `_deletedAt`), not permanent. Returns 400 if filament has variants.
- The `settings{}` bag on filaments is a passthrough for slicer-specific keys — unknown keys round-trip without modification. Don't touch this in sync, except via the scoped `merge_filament_settings()` path for the two OpenTag identity keys (see "What NOT to do" below).
- The `spoolWeight` and `netFilamentWeight` fields are on the FILAMENT, not individual spools. All spools of the same filament share the same tare weight.
- Spool subdocument `_id` values are stable across filament updates (Mongoose doesn't regenerate them on parent save).

### Spoolman data model gotchas
- Extra fields must be created via the Spoolman API or UI BEFORE they can be written to on a spool/filament. The bridge should check for required extra fields on startup and warn (or offer to create them) if missing.
- `GET /api/v1/spool` paginates — the default limit may not return all spools. Always pass `?limit=1000` or implement pagination.
- Vendor deduplication is extremely common — same vendor appearing with different IDs due to case differences ("ELEGOO" vs "Elegoo"), whitespace, or duplicate manual entries. The bridge matcher needs to handle this.
- Spoolman spool has `remaining_weight` (current net) and `used_weight` (total consumed). OctoPrint calls `PUT /api/v1/spool/{id}/use` which decrements remaining and increments used.
- Spoolman filament has `spool_weight` (tare) which may or may not be set. Default to ~200g if missing during weight conversion.

### Deep links (UI requirement)
Every record in the bridge UI must show two clickable icons linking to that record in each upstream system. Routes verified against live instances (see `docs/decisions.md`):
- Filament DB: `{FILAMENTDB_URL}/filaments/{filamentdb_id}` (plural). Filament DB has **no standalone spool page** — spools render under the filament page, so spool rows link to the parent filament URL.
- Spoolman: `{SPOOLMAN_URL}/spool/show/{spoolman_spool_id}` or `{SPOOLMAN_URL}/filament/show/{spoolman_filament_id}` (no hash routing).
- URLs are constructed from the `FILAMENTDB_URL` and `SPOOLMAN_URL` env vars
- Open in new tabs

## Development workflow

### Running locally for development

1. Start Filament DB and Spoolman (Docker or local instances)
2. Backend: `cd backend && pip install -r requirements.txt && uvicorn app.main:app --reload --port 8090`
3. Frontend: `cd frontend && npm install && npm run dev` (Vite proxies API calls to backend)
4. Set required env vars: `FILAMENTDB_URL=http://localhost:3000 SPOOLMAN_URL=http://localhost:7912`

### Building the Docker image

```bash
docker build -t filament-bridge .
```

### Running tests

```bash
cd backend && pytest
cd frontend && npm test
```

### Database migrations

SQLite schema changes go through Alembic:
```bash
cd backend && alembic revision --autogenerate -m "description"
cd backend && alembic upgrade head
```

## What NOT to do

- Don't modify Filament DB or Spoolman source code — all integration via REST APIs only
- Don't auto-resolve conflicts — always queue for user decision
- Don't delete records in upstream systems without explicit user action
- Don't overwrite Filament DB spool weights directly — always use the usage endpoint to preserve audit trail
- Don't assume Spoolman extra fields exist — check on startup
- Don't store upstream API data in SQLite beyond what's needed for diffing — the bridge stores snapshots and mappings, not a full copy of both databases
- Don't touch the `settings{}` bag on Filament DB filaments — it's slicer passthrough data.
  **SCOPED EXCEPTION (approved 2026-06-06):** `FilamentDBClient.merge_filament_settings()` is the
  single permitted path, and it MAY only merge the two OpenTag identity keys
  (`openprinttag_slug` / `openprinttag_uuid`) into the bag (read-modify-write, preserving ALL other
  keys, idempotent). Called by the OpenTag cleanup apply endpoint and the sync engine's
  `_sync_opentag_identity` pass. No other code may write to `settings{}`. See `docs/decisions.md`.
